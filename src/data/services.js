      description: `This is the first step to bringing a new website to life. It's where the pen goes to paper - or in our case, the mouse goes to the screen. Design is more about just using pretty colors or fancy animations, it's where you build our the entire experience for you users from start to finish. With over 4 years of UI/UX (user interface and user experience), graphic design and testing experience, I'm able to intimately get to know you an you and your project inside and out and make a tangible draft that you can test yourself on desktop, tablet and mobile - clicks and all.`

      description: `Now that we have a working draft of the UI/UX and design will be, the actual coding (my favorite part) begins. By using the latest web development frameworks, methodologies and and technologies, I'm able to create the same beautiful designs we created earlier into a fast and modern website or application that works on all browsers and screen sizes with built in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and analytics tracking.`

      summary: `Testing every page and component on desktop, tablets and mobile to ensure that every user has a great experience.`,
      description: `The next step is to test all the code that was just created. Every browser, user, and internet connection speed are completely different and it's important to ensure that every button, page, animation and form works exactly as expected. That way your users will have the smoothest experience on your site as possible, whether on a smartphone with a crappy Wi-Fi connection or an over-the-top 50' monitor.`

      description: `We're almost done! At this point, our code is done, thoroughly tested and ready for "the Big Time." In order to post the site online for the world to see, I'll hook up the code to a host (such as Amazon Web Services or Netlify), purchase a domain name (i.e. yourwebsitename.com) and then "voila!" - add a few important optimizations and we're left with a live website to be very proud of.`

I'm also fluent with most popular web platforms, such as WordPress (which powers about 30% of the internet), Squarespace, Wix and Shopify and am more than happy to offer advice and/or offer a free price quote if you send a quick message through my contact form.`
