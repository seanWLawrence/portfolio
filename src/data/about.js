I also play guitar (blues mostly), powerlift (185 lb bench, 285 lb squat 235 lb deadlift), ride motorcycles, travel around the world (3+ countries and 20+ states in the US), and shoot photos/videos in my spare time. Send me a message on my home page if you'd like to chat about your project or geek out over any of the hobbies I just mentioned. Talk soon!`
