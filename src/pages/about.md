I'm passionate about building high performance websites and applications. By using the latest HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies on a daily basis, I've cultivated a deep understanding of SEO (Search Engine Optimization), user experience, and design best practices to increase engagement, sales and brand recognition.

Whether you're a business, non-profit organization, open source project or blogger, I'd love to learn more about your project and help bring it to life - I'm even happy to offer free advice. Let's talk!
